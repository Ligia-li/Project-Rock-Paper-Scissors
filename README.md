# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors

First we get computer choice.
Second we get the human choice with prompt and lowerCase so we can take even if we type uppercase words.
Third we use a if depending on what human and computer selects and base by that we know who lose and who wins.
Fourth we play the game five times and take the score.
Then game over.
